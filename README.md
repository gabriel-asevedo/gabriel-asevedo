### 🧩 A little more about me

<img align="right" width="355" height="224" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/225813708-98b745f2-7d22-48cf-9150-083f1b00d6c9.gif" />

```
I am a bachelor's student in information systems, fascinated by programming and
data, highly dedicated and always looking for opportunities and knowledge.

🔭 I have knowledge in full-stack development, but more ease in the backend
📚 I think each programming language has its pros and cons, so I'm always willing to learn whatever it takes to adapt to a given context
🪐 With this, I mainly had contact with the languages/frameworks Java, Ruby On Rails, Python, C, JavaScript, Flutter, among others..
🌐 In a diverse context: Git, Scrum, Kanban, clean code, design patterns, unit testing, data structure and software architecture
🎲 About data, in the more technical part, I have knowledge in Python, Pandas, Excel, statistics, Power BI, SQL and NoSql
⚡ A curiosity: My favorite song is 'The Nights' by Dj Avicii ◢◤
🌱 "Do your best, under the conditions you have, while you don't have better conditions, to do even better"
